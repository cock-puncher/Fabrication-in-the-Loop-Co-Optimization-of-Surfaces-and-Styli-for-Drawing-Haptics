# Welcome

This a repository containing supplementary files for our project Fabrication-in-the-Loop Co-Optimization of Surfaces and Styli for Drawing Hapticspublished on Siggraph 2020. More information on the project, as well as, the full paper are available on our [project webpage](https://www.pdf.inf.usi.ch/projects/SurfaceStylusCoOpt/index.html).

## main.m

Example usage of the optimization with our dataset

## BayesianOptimization.m

Implementation of the optimization using Gaussian Processes. When executed the code suggests new tool and surface design to be manufactured

## features.mat

Dataset of measured drawing tool and surface designs for ourt project

## expected_improvement2D.m

Reference implementation of the analytical improvement function for two-dimensional distance minimization for Gaussain Processes

## GeneratePatternFrequency.m

A sample implementation of a freuqency-based Gabor filter that takes the input npoise parameters and generates a binary mask for single-layer printing processes.

## fit_GP_proxy.m

Example of Gaussian processes for predicting perceived friction and vibration using the reference implementation in matlab

## maximize_expected_improvement_genetic.m

Genetic algorithm style optimization of new drawing tools and substrates.

## Measurements

The friction and vibration measurements of each datasample captured by the device from our previous project Perception-Aware Modeling and Fabrication of Digital Drawing Tools. More details available on the [project webpage](http://pdf.mmci.uni-saarland.de/projects/DigitalStylus/).
